This little project is a showcase of how I work with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, and DOM.

The app that you see here changes the background color using DOM. And the other part creates a list of items and check if the item added already exists. The app checks also if that is an uppercase of the same word, and if there is, the app do not include the item to our list.
